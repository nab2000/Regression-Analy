Executive Summary: 



```{r}
library(GGally)
data("mtcars")
ggpairs()
df <- data.frame(mpg = mtcars$mpg, trans = mtcars$am)
df$trans <- factor(df$trans, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))

```

Look at pairs plots to see what effects mpg, then build a linear model that includes these and transmission, then look at coefficient of transmission and compare this to single variable model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(df$trans, df$mpg, ylab = "mpg")
```

```{r, echo = F}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = mpg, fill = trans))
p + geom_bar(binwidth = 2)
```
